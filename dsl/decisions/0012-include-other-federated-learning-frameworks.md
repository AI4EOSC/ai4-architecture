# 12. Include other federated learning frameworks

Date: 2024-03-01

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Only Flower.ai was considered, but we need to broaden the scope of it,
including other frameworks as NVFlare.

## Decision

Include NVFlare into the design. Expand a "Federared learnin server" so that it
can include additional frameworks.

## Consequences

Users will be able to deploy two different flavors of the federated learning
server.
