# 16. Use CI/CD enforcing platform level checks

Date: 2023-11-01

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The QA checks were configured via a Jenkinsfile that was stored in the user
repo. This file contained a mixture of user defined tests, platform specific
tests, notifications, etc. This created a great inconsistency between modules
(as a user could modify it) and it was hard to maintain, as a platform-wide
change must be applied to all repos individually.

## Decision

Define different jobs in Jenkins.

 - AI4OS QA specific tests, that are defined via an external Jenkinsfile and
   are enforced on all the catalog modules. The QA file is stored in a
   [separeted repository](https://github.com/ai4os/ai4os-hub-qa).

 - User defined tests, that are defined inside the user repository.

## Consequences

Platform-wide testing and quality assurance will be easier to maintain. A new
repository must be maintained.
