## Status

Accepted

## Context

The AI4EOSC will leverage the DEEP-Hybrid-DataCloud project architecture and
record the architectural decisions made on it.

## Decision

We describe the DEEP-Hybrid-DataCloud architecture using the C4 model.  We will
use Architecture Decision Records, as [described by Michael
Nygard](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).
