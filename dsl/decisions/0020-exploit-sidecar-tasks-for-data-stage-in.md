# 20. Exploit sidecar tasks for data stage-in

Date: 2024-06-20

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Widely used open data repositories (e.g. Zenodo, Figshare) provide APIs to
search for datasets and to gather data. AI4EOSC users and other related
projects are sometimes storing data on them, therefore it is desirable to
provide an integration mechanism to download data into the platform.

## Decision

Implement sidecar tasks in the job allowing to download data based on DOI.
Allow to browse Zenodo communities, as this is the most commonly used community
repository.

## Consequences

Data management (i.e. data download) becomes easier in the platform.
