# 4. Add order system for user management

Date: 2022-05-03

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need a way to track the new requests coming from the EOSC portal, as the
EOSC ordering system is incomplete.

## Decision

Implement an order service so that we can keep track of orders coming from the
portal or for new users coming directly to our platform.

## Consequences

Implement an ordering application with direct links with the IAM.
