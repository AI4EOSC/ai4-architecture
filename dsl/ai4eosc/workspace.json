However, we consider that these\nare not needed as the exchange is managed via git repositories and the training\ndatabase is stored directly as metadata in the workload management system.\n\n## Decision\n\nRemove the database components, but the API implementation should consider that\nwe may change to an external database in the future, therefore its design\nshould allow for an easy switch.\n\n## Consequences\n\nNo standalone databases are considered for the time being.\n",

Deploying CVAT in Nomad\n\nDate: 2024-06-01\n\n## Status\n\nAccepted\n\n## Context\n\nThere were two possibilities to deploy CVAT for users:\n\n1) deploy per-user CVAT\n2) deploy platform-wide CVAT\n\nAnd we have to fullfil the following requirements:\n\n**Requirement 1**: we need persistence if we don't want to constantly\nregenerate users and annotation tasks\n\n- with option 1:\n  possible, saving the database to Nextcloud.\n\n- with option 2:\n  straithforward\n\n**Requirement 2**: we need Nextloud to save annotations\n\n- with option 1:\n  possible, as we are mounting the virtual filesystem ourselves in /storage.\n\n- with option 2:\n  not possible as Nextcloud is not a supported storage in CVAT. And we\n  cannot mount the user-specific storage as earlier because this is\n  platform-wide.\n\n\n**Requirement 3**: we have to support EGI authentication\n\n- with option 1:\n  Straightforward, as authentication is done from the Dashboard\n\n- with option 2:\n  in theory only supported in the entreprise version. But this can\n  (possibly?) be overcomed by using a reverse proxy to create users, like\n  in the MLflow instance. Maybe can be implmented using CVAT API?\n\n\n**Summary**:\nOnly Req.3 is a real hard requirement, while Req.1/2 are more like\nconvenient features.\n\nSo the voting is among:\n\nOption 1:\n- persistence\n- not latest CVAT (more maintenance work in the Nomad job if we want to\n  keep it updated - though no big changes expected)\n- dedicated resources\n- straightforward EGI integration\n- Nextcloud support via virtual filesystem mounting\n\nOption 2:\n- persistence\n- latests CVAT\n- shared resources\n- more work initially to support EGI (thought possibly some work can be\n  reused from MLflow)\n- Nextcloud not supported\n\n\n## Decision\n\nOption (1) is the clear winner.\n\n## Consequences\n\nUsers will be able to choose to launch a CVAT instance from the Dashboard\nand this will be deployed in the Nomad platform.\n",

Apache Mesos is now being phased out, and therefore a\nnew solution needs to be integrated.\n\n## Decision\n\nAI4EOSC will use Hashicorp Nomad (and related tools like Consul) to deliver a\nplatform layer where the user workloads will be executed. Nomad provides\ndistributed scheduling across multiple sites, and a much simpler management\nwhen compared with analogous orchestration engines, like Kubernetes.\n\n## Consequences\n\nA new API will be delivered for the AI4EOSC platform, as already explained in\n[Decision 3](#3). This API will\ntherefore interact with the Nomad userver, using a robot account approach (i.e.\na single user submitting jobs on behalf of the original user), embedding the\nneeded metadata in the Nomad job.\n",

Use a single API endpoint for platform and marketplace\n\nDate: 2023-04-01\n\n## Status\n\nAccepted\n\n## Context\n\nThe previous architecture considered two API endpoints: one for exploring the\nmarketplace, one for interacting with the platform. However, this introduced an\nadditional complexity to the platform.\n\n## Decision\n\nMerge the two API endpoints into a platform-wide API: AI4-PAPI.\n\n## Consequences\n\nA single API will be developed, including all the required functionality.\n",
